# Task Manager v1.0

The Task Manager is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage their tasks. It provides features such as creating tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and saving tasks to a file for later use.

## Features

### 1. Create Task

Allows you to create a new task by providing a name, description, and priority. Tasks are stored in memory and can be accessed and modified throughout the session.

### 2. View Tasks

Displays a list of all the tasks, including their name, description, priority, and status (completed or pending). You can easily see an overview of all your tasks and their details.

### 3. Mark Task as Completed

Enables you to mark a task as completed based on its index in the task list. Once marked as completed, the status of the task will be updated accordingly.

### 4. Save Tasks to File

Allows you to save the tasks to a file for later use. You can choose a filename and store the tasks in a comma-separated format. This ensures that your tasks persist even after closing the application.

### 5. Load Tasks from File

Enables you to load tasks from a previously saved file. By providing the filename, you can retrieve and load tasks into the Task Manager, replacing any existing tasks.
